Even if the conversion algorithm (based on regular expressions) is not complete, it is a useful tool to speed up the porting of your apps in the most frequent cases, and, perhaps, if you do not need to convert a whole file or you don't want to upload it to third-party online tools.

Just paste in your strings and push the related button to convert them in either format.
